## Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)

> Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a comprehensive method for analyzing entire genomes. Genomic information has been instrumental in identifying inherited disorders, characterizing the mutations that drive cancer progression, and tracking disease outbreaks. Rapidly dropping sequencing costs and the ability to produce large volumes of data with today’s sequencers make whole-genome sequencing a powerful tool for genomics research. ([Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/techniques/sequencing/dna-sequencing/whole-genome-sequencing.html))

## Examples from Publications

### SKLA1.0 (Duck)

SKLA1.0 Duck Genome[^SKLA]

Species: Anas platyrhynchos (a native breed in China, using a hierarchical and hybrid approach)

Reads types: Nanopore, Bionano, and Hi-C data.
  - 71-fold normal and 24-fold ultra-long Nanopore reads

Result:
  - 40 chromosomes, improves the contig N50 of the previous duck assembly with highest contiguity (ZJU1.0) of more than a 5.79-fold
  - a complete genomic map of the MHC

Solved challenges:
  - traditional assembly tools have not enabled proper genomic draft of highly repetitive and GC-rich sequences, such as the MHC

Something I don't understand: 
  - C18 Duck?
  - heterozygosity estimation: why they do it? How could it help on the genome assembly?
  - What is BUSCO score?

#### Steps for Genome assembly:

1. **Estimate Genome Heterozygosity**
    - Before starting the assembly, the genome heterozygosity of the C18 duck was estimated. The heterozygosity was found to be as low as 0.58% (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Fig. S1-S3).
2. **Assemble Genome with ==Nanopore Reads==**
    - Using 71-fold normal and 24-fold ultra-long Nanopore reads, the duck genome was assembled into 151 contigs covering a total length of 1.22 Gb with a contig N50 of 32.81 Mb (Additional file 1: Table S2-S3).
    - [**NextDenovo**](https://github.com/Nextomics/NextDenovo): Clean and assembly
3. **Polish Contigs with ==Illumina Reads==**
    - The 151 contigs were then polished with 912 million 150-bp Illumina pair-end reads, corrected, and integrated with high-quality optical maps (Additional file 1: Table S4-S5). This effort generated 69 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 72.53 Mb (Additional file 1: Table S6).
    - **Nextpolish-1.2.3**[^NextPolish]: polished three rounds
4.  **Use ==Hi-C Data== for Scaffold Ordering**
    - A total of 274 Gb PE150 Hi-C data was used to order and orient the duck scaffolds, correct mis-joined sections, and merge overlaps, resulting in 40 super-scaffolds (Additional file 1: Table S7).
    - **Trimmomatic-0.36**[^Trimmomatic]; **Juicer software-1.5**[^Juicer]; **3d-DNA package-180922**[^3dDNA]; **Juicebox-1.13.01**[^Juicebox]
5. **Perform Gap Filling**
    - Gap filling was performed using 95-fold corrected Nanopore reads to remove gaps, generating the final duck assembly (SKLA1.0), representing 1.16 Gb of the genomic sequence, approximately 99.11% of the estimated genome size (Table 1).
    - **Gapcloser-0.56**[^Gapcloser]
6. **Chromosome Coverage and Comparison**
    - Since the duck contains 80 chromosomes (diploid, 2n=80), it was inferred that this duck assembly had covered all chromosomes except W (Additional file 1: Table S8). The SKLA1.0 assembly was compared with the previous duck BGI_duck_1.0 assembly, the ZJU1.0 assembly, and two high-quality avian reference genomes (chicken GRCg6a and zebra finch bTaeGut1.4.pri). These analyses indicated that the SKLA1.0 assembly represents a major improvement over the previous assemblies in terms of contiguity, completeness, and chromosome size. The contiguity and completeness of SKLA1.0 is also higher than that of the zebra finch bTaeGut1.4.pri and the chicken GRCg6a (Fig. 1a–d and Table 1).

#### After Assembly

1. Assessment
    - Burrows-Wheeler aligner14 (BWA) (v0.7.8) to map Illumina reads to the genome with matching rate was approximately 98.80%.
    -  Merqury15 (v1.3) was ran to evaluate assembly quality value (QV), and a high QV (42.14)
    - Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs16 (BUSCO) (v5.4.4) (use option “--augustus”) and Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach17 (CEGMA) (v2.5) were also used to assess the integrity
    - 238 of 248 core eukaryotic genes were detected using CEGMA
2. Comparison
    - Mummer18 (v4.0.0) was used to identify the synteny between A. marila and tufted duck19 (Aythya fuligula) genomes to determine orthologous chromosome pairs, and we used TBtools20 (v1.112) to draw the synteny between their chromosomes. 
3. Annotation of repetitive sequences
    - de novo prediction: Tandem Repeats Finder21 (TRF) (v4.09) to detect tandem repeat sequences
    - RepeatModeler (v2.0.3), RepeatScout22 (v1.0.6) and RECON (v1.08) were used to build a database of transposable element (TE)
    - RepeatProteinMask and RepeatMasker (v4.1.2-p1) were used for homology prediction with Repbase database23 and Dfam database24, the species parameter used was chicken.
4. Gene structure prediction
    - **Prediction Methods**:
       - **Ab Initio Prediction**: Used software Augustus (v3.3.2), GlimmerHMM (v3.0.4), and Geneid (v1.4.5).
       - **Homology-Based Prediction**: Utilized genomes and annotation files from six related species (Anser cygnoides, Anas platyrhynchos, Aythya fuligula, Cygnus olor, Cygnus atratus, Gallus gallus) downloaded from NCBI.
       - **RNA-Seq Prediction**: Processed raw data from six transcriptomic samples using fastp (v0.23.1), assembled paired-end reads with SPAdes (v3.15.3), identified candidate coding regions using TransDecoder (v5.5.0), and clustered sequences using CD-hit (v4.8.1).
    - **Integration**:
       - **Matching and Splicing**: Protein sequences from related species were matched to the A. marila genome using Spaln (v2.4.6) and accurately spliced with GeneWise (v2.4.1).
       - **Gene Set Generation**: Combined homology-based, RNA-Seq, and ab initio predictions using EvidenceModeler (EVM) (v1.1.1) and incorporated masked repeats.
5. **Databases and Tools**:
   - **DIAMOND**: Used for sequence alignment against SwissProt, TrEMBL, NR (Non-Redundant Protein Sequence Database), Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Orthology (KO) databases, with an e-value cutoff of 1e-5.
   - **InterPro**: Utilized for classifying proteins into families and predicting domains and important sites using InterProScan (v5.53).
6. Filtering and Verification of Gene Set for A. marila
    1. **Ortholog Identification**:
       - **OrthoFinder**: Used to identify orthologs among A. marila and six related species.
       - Resulted in 4,086 unassigned genes, of which 3,421 were not annotated in any database.
    2. **Filtering Process**:
       - Most unannotated genes (3,417/3,421) were predicted by at least one de novo prediction software, with only four supported by other evidence.
       - Removal of these unassigned genes did not affect the BUSCO test results, indicating they may not represent real genes.
    3. **Final Gene Set**:
       - After filtering out unassigned genes without annotations and 159 prematurely terminated genes, 15,953 genes remained, including 182 partial genes.
       - 98.96% of the final gene set was annotated.
